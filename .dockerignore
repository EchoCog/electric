# This `.dockerignore` file is used when building docker images from the repository root.
# In particular, we're building the `packages/e2e/satellite_client` that way, because it relies on
# other packages within the monorepo. Without this, the context sent to docker build engine
# is over 5Gb due to all the dependencies we don't need anyway.
